DUtils
======

DUtils is a small collection of utility functions, macros, defines, and typedefs for programming in C.  

The origin of this repository comes from having to rewrite a lot of things when doing low level projects, particularly in university for embedded systems.  

It is **by no means** a complete collection of utilities, or useful under all circumstances.  

Development is ongoing with new ideas coming from working on other projects.  

Feel free to contribute changes and additions you find useful, or find yourself rewriting many times.
